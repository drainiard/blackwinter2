# Black Winter 2

A game originally made by [Wong Yat Seng][1], rewritten in Rust.

## Dev Notes

### Legacy units and formats

- **Twips**
  Since the original project was written in VB6, sizes like window width and
  height were expressed in twips. To translate them in pixels we can use this website: [Convert twips to pixels][2]

- **FRX**
  Images were mostly embedded in `.frx` files as binary blobs, so we should extract them as standalone, standard format (e.g. PNG or JPG) files. This is what `extract_frx` is for.

**~ Finding a Graphics Library**
`2018-01-17`

**Attempt #1: Piston.rs**

Before starting the project I went to [arewegameyet](http://arewegameyet.com)
(a website that aggregates useful info and links to game-related Rust libraries
and resources).

This first attempt didn't go very well, I tried running [an example][3] to see
how to instantiate a window and draw a sprite in it, but had troubles due to
[this issue][4].

**Attempt #2: ggez.rs**

I decided to give up and try ggez.rs which was also mentioned on a cool talk
(you can find the [video on youtube](5)) given by @lisapassing at RustFest
ZÃ¼rich 2017.

ggez appears simpler to understand.
