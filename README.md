# Black Winter 2
A game originally made by [Wong Yat Seng][1], rewritten in Rust.

## Dev Notes
Since the original project was written in VB6, sizes like window width and
height were expressed in twips. To translate them in pixels I used this website:
 - [Convert twips to pixels][2]

**~ Finding a Graphics Library**
`2018-01-17`

**Attempt #1: Piston.rs**

Before starting the project I went to [arewegameyet](http://arewegameyet.com)
(a website that aggregates useful info and links to game-related Rust libraries
 and resources).

This first attempt didn't go very well, I tried running [an example][3] to see
how to instantiate a window and draw a sprite in it, but had troubles due to
[this issue][4].

**Attempt #2: ggez.rs**

I decided to give up and try ggez.rs which was also mentioned on a cool talk
(you can find the [video on youtube](5)) given by @lisapassing at RustFest
ZÃ¼rich 2017.

ggez appears simpler to understand.

Sadly I'm [having issues here as well](6), apparently all Rust graphics libraries
depend on an openGL version that is not available on my OS right now.
